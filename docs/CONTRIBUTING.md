# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the wider community.

We have a [roadmap](https://github.com/Geovation/tiler/projects/1) which can be seen under the projects page, which gives a rough idea of where we want to take the project going forward.

Feel free to fork and make a pull request with any improvements for the project you may have.

Alternatively feel free to create an issue for features/improvements you would like to see.
